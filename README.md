# Codepath-Wordpress
The XSS vuneralability
Wordpress version 4.2 is vulnerable to a xxs attack.
The Example "public" page can be attacked be inserting a simple script into the comments section under the reply area of the page.
As you can see in the example I inserted a simple script which exucuted as soon as the "Post Comment" button was pressed.
Then the XSS attack was successful.
